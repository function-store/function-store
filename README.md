# 👋 Hi, I'm Daniel Molnar / Dan / Function Store

I'm a **creative technologist, visual artist and music producer** based in Berlin working at the intersection of **real-time systems, generative visuals, and sound**.  
My work focuses on developing **tools, frameworks, and installations** that merge **TouchDesigner**, **Python**, and **audiovisual expression** into cohesive, interactive systems.

- 💡 **System Design:** I build integrated real-time systems that synchronize motion, light, and sound — from **volumetric LED installations** to **interactive environments**.  
- 🎛️ **TouchDesigner Expertise:** Deeply involved in TouchDesigner’s community-driven ecosystem; I develop modular systems, share techniques, and perform live.  
- 🔊 **Audiovisual Integration:** I design performances and installations where movement, light, and sound directly influence one another in real time.
